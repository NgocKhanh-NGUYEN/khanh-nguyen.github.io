Hello,

I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in Medical Biology at The Centre for Immunology and Microbial Infections, which is a multidisciplinary research unit affiliated with Sorbonne University, Inserm, and CNRS. The centre is located on the Pitié-Salpêtrière campus of Sorbonne University’s Faculty of Medicine in Paris. I am fortunate to join the research team of Pr. Guy Gorochov “Study and manipulation of tolerance in human immunopathology” since March 2022.
